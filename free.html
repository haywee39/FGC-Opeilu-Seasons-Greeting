        <h1>THE FREE GIFT</h1>
        <p>
            What an amazing offer from God:  “There
is forgiveness through the blood of My Son.” <br>
Whoever believes this wonderful offer can
accept it. It is not a reward for our services;
it is the gift of God through Jesus Christ. <br>
 It is not given because we are worthy to receive it,
but because it is a gift worthy of God to give. <br>
The gospel of salvation is just this:
 a simple offer on God’s side and simple acceptance
on ours! <br>
 An undeserved offer like this is often ignored because people think it must be
earned. <br>
But this leads to two serious mistakes. <br>
First, it nurtures the idea of some that
something in them entitles them to salvation. <br>
Second, it confirms the gloom of others who
look into their own hearts and lives and find
nothing there deserving divine favor. <br>
The error lies in looking to themselves instead
of looking to the Savior: <br>
 “Look to Me, and be saved, all you ends of the earth” (Isaiah
45:22).  <br>
The Lord Jesus Christ was crucified so that
“whoever believes in Him should not perish
but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). <br>
You are urged to take this wonderful offer. Do not
hesitate; only believe! <br>
God has promised that with His Son, He
will freely give you all things (Romans 8:32); <br>
that He will walk with you and dwell in you
(2 Corinthians 6:16), <br>
that He will purify your
heart by faith (Acts 15:9), <br>
and that He will put His law in your heart and write it in your
mind (Hebrews 10:16). <br>
These are the results of salvation in Christ,
and not your entitlement to it. <br>
Your first step is confident acceptance of an offer that is free,
generous, and unconditional.  <br>
If I could come as an accredited agent
from heaven with an invitation for you, <br>
complete with your name and address on it,
you would no doubt accept it. <br>
Even so, the Bible, God’s Word, extends an invitation to
come to Christ. <br>
It does not have your name and address, but it says, <br>
 “whoever,” and that
includes you. <br>
It says, “all,” and that refers to
you. <br>
It says, “any,” and that means you. <br>
What can be more sure or more free than that? <br>
Salvation without money, 
Salvation without price,<br>
Salvation without labor –
Believing will suffice; <br>
Salvation for the guilty, 
Salvation for the lost; <br>
Salvation for the wretched, 
The sad and tempest-tossed. <br>
Our sins were borne by Jesus,
The Substitute from God; <br>
He took them all, and freed us
From sin’s accursed load. <br>
Our guilt was borne by Jesus,
Who washed the crimson stains
White in His blood most precious, <br>
Until no spot remains.
